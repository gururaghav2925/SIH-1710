## Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations
## Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

## Idea
Develop a multi-platform navigation system for railway stations that helps passengers locate facilities such as platforms, ticket counters, restrooms, and food courts using interactive 3D maps, voice navigation, and real-time updates via mobile apps and digital kiosks.

## Proposed Solution 
A smart station navigation ecosystem that includes:
  Mobile Application
    3D interactive station map
    Indoor GPS or Bluetooth-based location tracking
    Step-by-step real-time navigation
    Voice assistance for visually impaired
    Multilingual support (English, Hindi, etc.)

 Digital Kiosks
    Installed at major entry and transit points
    Touch-based UI with the same navigation features
    QR code generation to transfer route to mobile

 Admin Dashboard
    Used by railway staff to update facilities, reroute paths, and view analytics

## Use Cases
1.New Passenger: Locates platform and restrooms using 3D map on phone.

2.Visually Impaired User: Uses voice-guided navigation to reach assistance counter.

3.Kiosk User: Finds food court via touch-screen interface and receives a QR code to continue navigation on phone.

4.Admin Staff: Updates closed facilities or reroutes paths due to maintenance.
